## Overview
Security is crucial for a multi-enterprise application, where users of the application are restricted to accessing and updating any data pertaining only to the enterprise(s) they are associated with. For example, users associated with enterprise A will never be able to view and update any data from enterprise B. Within an enterprise, users will also have different roles with varying sets of permissions.
