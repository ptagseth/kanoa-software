:::caution Developer Note
Need some design work here.

Kano_Config needs to change as we may have multiple Enterprises in future.

Downtime, enterpriseView, oeeSelection and site need to be moved to under kanoa for each session or even deleted as they have been replaced now by the selectors section under kanoa\designer\selectors.

oeeColors should move to under kanoa or be moved to a tag dataset.

Translations should move to under kanoa

viewNameâ€¦ is it even needed anymore?
