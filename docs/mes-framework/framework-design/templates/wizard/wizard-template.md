The wizard template is a guided user interface that helps its user navigate through a series of steps in order to complete a task or process. The Wizard Template is designed to compile a list of steps, to accumulate every data field across all of them, and to execute the overall task. More details on how to create and configure a step [here](docs/mes-framework/framework-design/templates/wizard/step-template-documentation.md).
