Shifts can be created and assigned to assets, areas and sites. Shifts created for a site are then used by all assets at that site unless a specific asset has been setup for the asset or the area in which an asset resides.  
Shifts are configured with recurring rules and a single shift can have multiple entries to support complex shift rotation patterns.  
A shift can be edited for a specific day or time period to create a custom shift for that period of time.
