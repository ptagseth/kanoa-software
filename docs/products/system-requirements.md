## Hardware
The Ignition Gateway server can be on-premises or in the cloud. It can be a physical or virtual machine. It can be windows based or Linux. Recommendation is for at least 3 cores and 16 Gbytes of memory. SQL Server 2018 or higher can be installed on the same server or a separate server. If the same server is used, it is recommended to increase the server size to at least 24 Gbytes of RAM. Follow the recommendations for number of CPUâ€™s for SQL and note this will affect the licensing costs for SQL.
