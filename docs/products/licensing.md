# Software Licensing
The Kanoa Ops Framework can be purchased for an enterprise. With that purchase, the framework can be installed for as many sites, production lines and servers as required for the client.  

SQL Server will require licensing and it is expected that for the most part, a clients IT department will provide a database for this purpose.  

An Ignitionâ„¢ license will also be required. The only requirements for the MES Framework are the Perspective module and platform and the [BIJC Calendar Component Module](https://modules.bijc.co.uk/?page_id=76).  

It is recommended that MQTT be used for data transmission between machines and the Kanoa Ops Framework, in which case the MQTT Engine and MQTT Distributor modules will need to be installed on the MES Gateway and the MQTT Transmission modules will be installed on the edge devices.
