Shifts can be created by clicking <AddIcon fontSize="small" /> icon and assigned to assets, areas and sites. Shifts created for a site are then used by all assets at that site unless a specific asset has been setup for the asset or the area in which an asset resides.  

Shifts are configured with recurring rules and a single shift can have multiple entries to support complex shift rotation patterns.  

A shift can be edited for a specific day or time period to create a custom shift for that period of time. Shifts can be assigned different colors - to distinguish one shift from the other in the calendar view.

Shifts utilize the timezone of the asset if this is configured.  If a timezone is not set, it will default to the device used.
