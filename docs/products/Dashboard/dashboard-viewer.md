## Dashboard Viewer
Use the Dashboard Selector to select a dashboard to view.  If this is a dashboard you will view frequently, you can add it to your favorites.  Dashboards can be viewed using many different media, including mobile and tablet devices.

### Select Dashboard
Click the top left icon in the top bar (ribbon) for the dashboard selector to view the folders and dashboards available.  Select the dashboard to view.

Private Dashboards and Folders have an asterisk at the end of the name.  E.g. MyFolder* or MyDashboard*.
Private folders can have private folders or dashboards, but private folders can't have public folders or dashboards.
