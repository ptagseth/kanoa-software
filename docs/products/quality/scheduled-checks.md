Based on the triggers defined for a check sheet and the line status (shift, mode and product) coming from MES, scheduled checks are automatically created. Scheduled Checks can be viewed from **Quality > Scheduled Checks** in the Ops application navigation sidebar.

## Operator Console

A Quality Check card shows all active checks for an asset. An active check is any check that has a status of Coming Due, Due or Overdue. Clicking on the check brings up the Check Entry screen. Clicking on the + sign provides a method for adding a manual check. Clicking on the <EyeIcon fontSize="small" /> brings up the Scheduled Checks screen.

## Scheduled Check Screen

Checks can be filtered based on asset, product, manual and auto checks, by date and by status. The status filter menu can be hidden by clicking the filter button.

Manual checks can be added <AddIcon fontSize="small" />, and checks can be edited <EditIcon fontSize="small" />.
