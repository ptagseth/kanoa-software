The Detail report provides a view on individual check values. 

At this time, there are two SPC charting options, ‘Individual’ and ‘Histogram’. The Histogram chart provides Process Capability charting, while the Individual allows for individual data point analysis.

The light blue chart at the top of each plot displays the density of data points and can be used to select time ranges of interest.

The Min, Mean, Max, std Dev., LCL and UCL values are calculated based on the datapoints displayed. If Target, LSL and USL specifications have been defined for the attribute, then the cP and cPK values will be calculated.
