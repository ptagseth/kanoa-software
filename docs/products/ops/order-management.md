Production orders can be created and edited in the Production Order Management screen. Production orders can also come from an ERP system via web service calls or middle ware tables. 

This page will show the status of production orders along with assets they have been scheduled on and actual quantity produced against them.

The data can be downloaded into an Excel format.
