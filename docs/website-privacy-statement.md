This Privacy Statement sets forth the information gathering, use, and dissemination practices of www.kanoa.ai and/or its affiliates, partners, and assigns, ("Kanoa") in connection with the World Wide Web site located at www.kanoa.ai, and any affiliated subpages ("Site").  This Privacy Statement applies solely to information Kanoa learns about you or obtains from you when you visit Kanoa’s Site.  This Privacy Statement does not address or govern any information gathering, use, or dissemination practices related to information collected in any other way.

Kanoa can be contacted by mail at PO Box 25282 Federal Way, Washington 98093, by phone at (253) 240-9914, or by e-mail at info@kanoa.ai.

Your access or use of the Site constitutes your legally binding acceptance of, and agreement to, this Privacy Statement.  This Privacy Statement may be changed at any time.  It is your obligation as a user visiting the Site to familiarize yourself with this Privacy Statement.  Any change to this Privacy Statement shall also be effective as to any visitor who has visited the Site before the change was made.


### 1. Collection of Personal Information from Site Visitors

Kanoa may collect or track:

* The home server domain names, e-mail addresses, type of client computer, files downloaded, search engine used, operating system, and type of web browser of visitors to the Site,

* Your e-mail addresses if you communicate with Kanoa via e-mail,

* Information you knowingly provide in online forms, registration forms, surveys, e-mail, and other online avenues (including, without limitation, demographic and personal profile data), and

* Aggregate and user-specific information regarding which pages Site visitors access.

In addition to information you provide, Kanoa may collect the name of the domain and host from which you access the internet; the IP address of the computer you are using; and the browser and operating system you are using; the date and time you accessed the Site; and the internet address of the web site from which you linked to the Site.  Kanoa may place internet "cookies" on visitors' hard drives.  Internet cookies can save data about individual visitors, such as the visitor's name, user-name, and the pages of a site viewed by the visitor.  When the visitor revisits the Site, the Site may recognize the visitor by the internet cookie and customize the visitor's experience accordingly.  Visitors may disable internet cookies, if any, by using the appropriate feature of their web client software, if available.

When a visitor performs a search within the Site, Kanoa may record information identifying the visitor or linking the visitor to the search performed.  Kanoa may also record limited information for every search request and use that information to solve technical problems with the services available directly or indirectly in connection with the Site and to calculate overall usage statistics.


### 2. Use of Personal Data Collected

Personal data collected by Kanoa may be used by Kanoa for many reasons.  Examples may include, editorial and feedback purposes, for marketing and promotional purposes, for a statistical analysis of users' behavior, for service development, for content improvement, for fulfillment of a requested transaction or recordkeeping, or to customize the content and layout of the Site.  Aggregate data on visitors' home servers may be used for internal purposes, and individually identifying information, such as names, postal and e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and other personal information which visitors voluntarily provide to Kanoa may be added to Kanoa’s databases and used for future contact, mailings, and e-mail communications regarding Site updates, news, new services, and upcoming events.

Kanoa may also use Site visitor data to contact the Site visitors regarding account status and changes to the submissions agreement, privacy statement, and any other policies or agreements relevant to Site visitors.


### 3. Disclosure of Personal Data to Third Parties

Kanoa will not generally disclose any personally identifiable information to third parties.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Kanoa may disclose or distribute identifiable or non-identifiable data to a third party under certain situations including:

1.  As necessary for the conduct of normal business.  For example, Kanoa may disclose your personally identifiable information in connections with bill payment by a third party.
2.  As required by law.  For example, Kanoa may disclose your personally identifiable information to a third party pursuant to a valid subpoena, court order, or other form of legal process.
3.  As determined by Kanoa in its sole judgment that disclosure or distribution is appropriate to protect the property of Kanoa or any other person or entity.  For example, Kanoa may disclose your personally identifiable information in response to a request by or on behalf of any local, state, federal, or other government agency, department, or body, whether or not pursuant to a subpoena, court order, or other form of legal process.

While Kanoa may undertake efforts to ensure that such third parties use the personal data solely for the purposes for which the data was disclosed, Kanoa is not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties and will not be liable for any use of disclosure, by a third party, of any user’s personal data.

This Site may contain links to other World Wide Web sites or advertisements for, or placed by, third parties.  Kanoa is not responsible for the privacy practices of such Web sites, advertisers, or third parties, or for the content of such sites or advertisements.  It is possible that these links or advertisements, themselves, may be used by third parties or others to collect personal or other information about Site visitors.  It is solely the visitors' obligation to review and understand the privacy practices and policies of these other web sites and of these advertisers and third parties.


### 4. Security Measures

Kanoa has implemented security features to prevent the unauthorized release of or access to users’ personal information.  Please be advised, however, that the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted to or from Kanoa via this Site or e-mail cannot be guaranteed.
