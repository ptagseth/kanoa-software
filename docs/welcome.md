## Documentation to get you started with the Kanoa MES framework.

### Kanoa Ops 
Kanoa Ops provides the fundamental elements required to orchestrate manufacturing operations and delivers insights and analytics on plant performance.

Kanoa Ops includes everything required for the day-to-day organization and operation of a manufacturing site, including classifying and organizing plant assets, defining products and materials, scheduling operators and shifts, and scheduling production runs and work orders. Once the work is organized and scheduled, Kanoa Ops also tracks performance, OEE, and downtime to provide production insights and analytics.

Kanoa Ops includes the following features out-of-the-box:  
* Work Order Management 
* Product Management 
* Operations Scheduling with recurrence rule support and auto-scheduling 
* Shift Scheduling with support for complex shift rotation patterns 
* Production Analytics including OEE 
* Web based mobile responsive application 
* Themes support 
* Language support (English, German, French, Italian, Korean, Chinese already provided)
* MQTT data transfer between edge devices and MES Server utilizing built-in store and forward capability for a robust network solution.

### Kanoa Quality
The Kanoa Quality Module for Ignition is a Quality Data system (QDS) that provides a comprehensive digital system for managing manufacturing quality.

Kanoa Quality allows users to create various Check Sheets that describe all of the quality checks that may be required at any point in the manufacturing process. These Check Sheets can then be scheduled based on manufacturing operating conditions like product changeovers, shift changes, machine mode changes, or timed intervals. When it is time for a quality check to be executed, the proper Check Sheet is presented to the operator (with instructions) so they can enter quality data manually and validate any automatically collected data.

Quality supervisors get a holistic view of all the Quality checks that are pending, due, in-progress, complete, or late; so they can take action to make sure tests are getting done. Kanoa Quality also provides out-of-the-box analytics on both the performance of quality checks and the data collected by those checks. 

Kanoa Quality provides the following:
* Environmental, Safety, Operations and Product Quality Management 
* Ability to create quality checks 
* Automatic scheduling of quality checks 
* Provides procedures and instructions for taking quality checks 
* Storage and data management of quality check data 
* Analytics and third-part audit reporting 
* Management of product and manufacturing process tolerances 
* Alarming and email notification on failed checks
