We have created a self-guided demo project that sits on top of the KanoaMES application. Click on any of the cards to navigate to that page. Hover over the header of a card to 
see the help about that page. Drag the handle on the left hand side or hit the menu button on the top bar to navigate to any part of the application. You can also use the built-in
navigation history to go back or forward to any page you have visited in the application.

Don't like our colors? No problem. Got to 'options' (cog on the right hand side) and select the theme you identify most with/

English not your first language? Then feel free to change to one of the languages we've have already provided. If your language isn't there yet, no problem. 
We built this on Ignition so you can add whatever language you like through the designer.

We appreciate you taking the time to look at our what we have to offer. We hope you like it!
