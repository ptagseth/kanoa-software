Welcome to the KanoaMES demo! We have created a self-guided project that sits on top of the KanoaMES application that will take you directly to a number of chosen pages.
Click on any of the cards to navigate to a specific page. The demo will automatically select an asset, a date range and trigger an action to get and fill
that page with information. <br />

### Navigating The Application
You can click the Home icon ![demo-help](/img/components/homeButton.png) at any time to get back to the main demo page. 
If you want to take a look at the KanoaMES application itself, you can click on the menu icon ![demo-help](/img/components/menuButton.png) to open up the navigation side bar.
You can also use the built-in navigation history ![demo-help](/img/components/navHistory.png) to go back or forward to any page you have visited in the application.

### Themes and Language Support
English not your first language? Then feel free to change to one of the languages we've have already provided in the options section ![demo-help](/img/components/optionsCog.png).
If your language isn't there yet, no problem. We built this on Ignition so you can add whatever language you like through the designer.<br />
Don't like our colors? No problem. Goto options and select the theme you identify most with<br />
