## Adding Product Attributes

Click the ‘Edit’ button at the top of the screen to edit or add a new product attribute. Clicking the ‘Add’ button will create a new row and the fields can be edited by clicking in them.


## Adding or Editing Product Tolerances

Click the ‘Add’ button to add a new product tolerance or double-click on a row in the table to edit a product tolerance. The Product Tolerance Editor is opened below the table. A tolerance can be applied to all products by leaving the Product Set and Product fields blank, or tolerances can be set for all products within a product set or for individual products. Tolerance parameters are the same as for process tolerances.
