# Kanoa Ops: Concept of a Run

## Overview

In Kanoa Ops, the concept of a 'Run' refers to a specific period during which a piece of equipment operates in a certain mode. A Run is essentially a mode event, representing the time frame in which an asset transitions into and out of a particular mode. This concept is central to understanding the operation and productivity of equipment in the Kanoa system.

## Definition and Characteristics of a Run

1. **Production and Non-Production Runs**: Runs can encompass both production (active manufacturing processes) and non-production activities (such as maintenance, idle time, or changeover).
2. **Association with Production Orders**: While runs can be linked to production orders – instructions for a production run with specific items, quality standards, and timelines – a run does not necessarily require a production order. Any scheduled or manually entered mode event with a defined start and end time is considered a run.
3. **Sequential Nature**: Runs are sequential and cannot overlap, as a machine can only be in one mode at any given time.

## Run Review Screen

- The Run Review Screen in Kanoa Ops offers a comprehensive view of all runs that occurred on a given asset. It details all mode transitions and is crucial for tracking and analyzing the operational history of equipment.

## Unique Aspects of Production Runs

1. **Data Collection**: Production runs are unique in that they involve collecting extensive production data.
2. **OEE Calculation**: During production runs, data related to Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) is gathered and calculated.
3. **Product Counting**: This includes counting products manufactured during the run and assessing production efficiency and effectiveness.

## Importance of Runs in Kanoa Ops

Understanding Runs in Kanoa Ops is essential for:
- Monitoring equipment utilization and productivity.
- Tracking the operational history of assets.
- Analyzing the efficiency of production processes.
- Optimizing manufacturing schedules and asset utilization.

## Conclusion

The concept of a Run in Kanoa Ops is a foundational element for tracking and managing the operational status of machinery and equipment. By clearly defining and monitoring Runs, Kanoa Ops enables users to gain valuable insights into their manufacturing processes, contributing significantly to productivity analysis and operational improvement.
