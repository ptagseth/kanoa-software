# Understanding the Concept of an Attribute in Kanoa Quality

## Introduction
In the Kanoa Quality system, the concept of an attribute plays a critical role in managing and associating data across various assets and products within a facility. This document aims to elucidate the functionality and significance of attributes in Kanoa Quality.

## Definition of an Attribute
- **Nature**: An attribute in Kanoa Quality is akin to a property or characteristic.
- **Reuse**: Attributes may be used across multiple assets and products.
- **Purpose**: They serve to link data points in Kanoa Quality with tags from automation equipment.

## Key Functions of an Attribute
1. **Data Source Association**:
   - An attribute can (but isn't required to) have a designated data source.
   - This data source is linked with an asset and a tag.
   - **Example**: For measuring a specific attribute on an asset, a corresponding tag is utilized to fetch data.

2. **Versatility Across Equipment**:
   - A single attribute can be defined for various equipment pieces.
   - Each equipment instance can have a distinct tag linked to this attribute.
   - **Example**: A "temperature" attribute associated with different temperature probes in a facility, each having a unique data source per asset.

3. **Tolerance Association**:
   - Attributes can be optionally associated with tolerances.
   - Allows setting of engineering specifications, control limits, and targets per asset and item.
   - This feature facilitates custom specifications and feedback mechanisms tailored to different equipment and materials.

## Application in Operational Context
- **Feedback to Operators**: Attributes are crucial for providing real-time feedback based on performance against predefined specifications.
- **Automatic Data Collection**: They facilitate the automatic collection of data from process equipment.
- **Flexibility**:
  - Attributes can adapt to different materials and equipment.
  - They allow different specification limits for various materials across multiple pieces of equipment.
  - A single piece of equipment can handle multiple materials, each with its own specification limits.

## Conclusion
Attributes in Kanoa Quality are foundational elements that bring flexibility and precision to the process of data management and quality control. Their ability to associate with various data sources and tolerances makes them an integral part of the Kanoa Quality system, enhancing operational efficiency and ensuring consistent quality across different assets and products.
