# Kanoa Quality Item Sets Configuration Screen

## Overview
The Kanoa Quality Item Sets Configuration screen is a critical feature in the Kanoa manufacturing software, designed for managing and organizing quality control parameters. This screen primarily deals with item classes and item sets, facilitating the creation of quality check sheets and the assignment of tolerances.

## Key Concepts
1. **Item List**: The main display shows a list of all items, detailing their respective item classes and association with item sets.
2. **Item Class**: Functions as a folder structure for organizing items. It's more about classification than defining quality parameters.
3. **Item Set**: A group of items with similar properties. Item sets are crucial for assigning unified quality specifications, like color or thickness.

## Functionalities
1. **Creating Tolerances**: Users can create specific tolerances for an item set, streamlining the process of checking if products meet the specified quality standards.
2. **Quality Check Sheets**: These can be associated with either individual items or item sets, allowing for efficient quality checks during production.
3. **Filtering Options**: The screen provides filters to view specific items or item sets, enhancing usability.
4. **Editing Item Sets**: Users can add items to, or unlink them from, an item set. Additionally, item sets can be edited, disabled, or deleted as needed.

## Key Operations
1. **Associating Items to Sets**: Select desired items and use the 'Item Set Linker' to associate them with a specific set.
2. **Editing Item Sets**: Use the edit pencil icon on the left bar to create, modify, or delete item sets. For instance, renaming a set or disabling it.
3. **Single Set Assignment**: An item can only belong to one item set at a time, ensuring clarity in determining which tolerances apply.

## Limitations
- An item cannot be part of multiple item sets, which simplifies the determination of applicable tolerances but may limit flexibility in certain scenarios.

## Conclusion
The Kanoa Quality Item Sets Configuration screen is an essential tool for managing quality parameters in a manufacturing context. By allowing the creation of item sets with specific tolerances and associating them with quality check sheets, it ensures a streamlined and efficient quality control process. This screen's functionalities cater to both the organizational and operational aspects of manufacturing quality management.
